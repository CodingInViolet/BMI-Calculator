# BMI-Calculator
This is a simple BMI Calculator made with Python.
It calculates the Body Mass Index by entering the data both in International Unit or Imperial Unit.
After this, it gives you the option to make another calculation or to exit the program.

This is my very first time coding at Python, and I learned how to make functions, how to use conditionals, and how to create a while bucle and to use the data obtained from the while bucle.
